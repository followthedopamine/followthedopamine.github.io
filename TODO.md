[Portfolio]

- Potentially generate all the colours for the text editor on load for performance
- Consider adding more info to readmes
- Add about page
- Add downloadable CV
- Update Banquet Blitz Play Store page
- Layout extra pages as vs code and then have the code type out when you scroll down?

Really good idea for a portfolio piece: algorithm visualizer - take leetcode problems and create a slowed down visual version of what's happening.

[Feedback from Olivier]

I think the content your portfolio being "ready" really depends on the position you are applying to. For example, if you were applying as a junior dev for web games, it might be perfect. If you were looking at a 3D open world game, it probably doesn't showcase that inclination.

There's nothing you can do for that other than adding more games or projects to it.

Now the part that is severely lacking in your portfolio is why you made these games.

Everyone hiring devs understands work in progress or game jams or personal projects.

You need to show that you are on a journey of improving your skills and exploring game development.

So each entry needs:

1. What you were trying to learn or prove with this prototype/release/game jam.
2. How much effort you committed to the prototype (in hours, ideally).
3. What you actually achieved or why you abandoned development at this point.

show potential employers that you are doing this to get better in a structured, somewhat scientific, way. They will see that you have that potential to grow from a junior developer to an expert, especially with the seniors and mentors they have at their disposal.
